\section{Comments and Suggestions}

It was clear the attention given to assure the quality of event. The topics addressed were clearly organized to deliver for the attendees different perspectives related to Health Innovation. The environment created by the organization also promoted discussions not only during the plenary sessions and panels, but also during the coffee breaks and social events. 
 
For the next year, a couple of changes would be beneficial.
The type of assignment should be reevaluated. The workshops are excellent opportunities for attendees to produce valuable outcomes. Those outcomes could be used to assign the students of the summer school. 
For example, the business model for a m-health solution that I helped to produce in the workshop \textit{Bussiness Model Innovation and Internationalization} could be used as an assignment.
In addition, would be interesting to see the perspective of Computer Science research into Health Innovation. 
So, the next edition should include a talk about the challenges to propose innovative IT (Information Technology) solutions for Health Care, for example the importance of data standardization for integration among health care providers.
