\section*{Reflections on the Content of HISS}

Interaction with people that take innovation as part of their lives, and have been creating new solutions for real-world problems. Having the contact with all those changing makers strongly motivated me to work even harder to produce high impact outcomes from my research.
 
Although the importance of interdisciplinary and collaboration have been reinforced in many ways into HH research environment, during the the summer school it was possible to experience that importance by not only watching the talks, but also, and most important, by interacting to researchers from different fields. 
For example, this exchange of ideas revealed some potential projects to use Smart Home technologies to support Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Exploring the similarities between business modeling techniques and the research method gave me a new perspective of how to approach my research problems, in particular how to model the problems. 
In some way, my research should be also treated as a product/service with a important value to some niche of the society. 
So, a clear understanding about the core value of my project could be used to propose a selling strategy for my research, with the difference that target market in that case is the research community where I belong to.
